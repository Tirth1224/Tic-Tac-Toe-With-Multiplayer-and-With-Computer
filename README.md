# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to play against each other or against a computer AI of varying difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Game Modes:**
  - **Two Player:** Play against another player locally.
  - **Computer (Easy):** Play against a simple AI.
  - **Computer (Hard):** Challenge yourself against a more advanced AI using the Minimax algorithm.

- **Player Selection:**
  - Choose to play as X or O.

- **Interactive Design:**
  - Winning animations when a player wins.
  - Restart button to reset the game.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Built using Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness.

## Game Mechanics

- The game board is a 3x3 grid where players take turns to place their marks (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
